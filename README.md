# Codewars
Challenge myself on kata, created by the community to strengthen different skills. Master current language of choice, or expand understanding of a new one.

I am going to record down the code and solution for each Codewars kata. I will not put the link or description of the kata to prevent copying codes to complete the kata. However, most of the function name is still available for reader to search on Google or GitHub.
Most of the early kata would be 8kyu to 5kyu difficulty. I will update my kata solution to here for every 50 questions I've completed.
